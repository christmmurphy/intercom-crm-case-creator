## Intercom Messenger App | Ruby Example

A simple Intercom Messenger App built with Ruby & Sinatra. This app will pull images from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ and ask the user for a rating.  

The rating will be posted on to the User's profile page in Intercom.

This is designed as a sample app for building Intercom Messenger apps in Ruby. The code is commented and includes links to some useful tools for manipulating the required json.

Check it out in the messenger [here](https://intercomcstest.wpengine.com/?page_id=144). First call might fail as Heroku Dynos spin up.
